# AnimalGuessingGame
Console type game created for CS305 Data Structures UP written in the C language.

DESCRIPTION

The console will try to guess what animal the user is thinking about by asking consecutive yes/no questions to the user.
Once the computer runs out of questions, the user wins and the console asks for a new yes/no question. 
All questions are written into a .txt file at the end of the game and uploaded again every time the game is started. 
For keeping track of the questions the program uses a binary tree data structure.
